# 🏛️ Ship of Theseus | High-Performance Research Node

![Workstation Hero Shot](image.png)

## 🔬 Research Vision
I am an Electrical Engineering student at **Texas State University** (Concentration: **Micro & Nano Devices**). This workstation, the "Ship of Theseus," is my primary hub for self-directed research, simulating experiments, and bridging theoretical coursework with physical engineering.

Everything built here is a foundational step toward my ultimate objective: earning a **PhD in Materials Science, Engineering, and Commercialization (MSEC)**.
