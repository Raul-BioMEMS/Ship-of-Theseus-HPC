## 🔬 Research Vision & PhD Pathway
[cite_start]I am an Electrical Engineering student at **Texas State University** (Concentration: **Micro & Nano Devices**)[cite: 7, 8]. [cite_start]This workstation, the "Ship of Theseus," is my primary hub for self-directed research, simulating experiments, and bridging theoretical coursework with physical engineering[cite: 17, 18].

[cite_start]Everything built here is a foundational step toward my ultimate objective: earning a **PhD in Materials Science, Engineering, and Commercialization (MSEC)**[cite: 7].
