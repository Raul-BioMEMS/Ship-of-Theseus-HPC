## 🔬 Research Vision & PhD Pathway
I am an Electrical Engineering student at **Texas State University** with a concentration in **Micro & Nano Devices**. This workstation, the "Ship of Theseus," serves as my primary hub for self-directed research, bridging theoretical coursework with physical engineering applications.

Everything built here is a foundational step toward my ultimate objective: earning a **PhD in Materials Science, Engineering, and Commercialization (MSEC)**.

## 📅 Professional Availability
I am actively seeking **Co-op opportunities (Summer 2026 – Winter 2026)** or Undergraduate Research positions. I am prepared for 6-8 month extended rotations to contribute to long-term engineering pipelines.

### 🎯 Target Roles:
* **Digital Logic / RTL Design Intern:** Applying SystemVerilog for bio-inspired compute models.
* **Hardware Test & Diagnostics Intern:** Proficient in component-level PCB probing and multimeter diagnostics.
* **Systems Programming Intern (Rust/Linux):** Developing localized CLI agents and performance monitors on Fedora.
* **Micro/Nano Research Assistant:** Supporting Bio-MEMS simulation and laboratory characterization.
